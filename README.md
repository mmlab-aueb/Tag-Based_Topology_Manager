We introduce an opesource implementation of a Tag - Based Topology Manager in Software Defined Networks. We implement a SDN Controller that is 
aware of network topology and install forwarding rules in bloom filter switches according to node " tags ". Each node is characterized from 
some attributes and the Topology Manager suggest paths according to that attributes using bloom filters.In addition the SDN Controller is 
installing forwarding flows based on that information. With that proposal we argue that we can control strategically the network and make it 
more efficient.
